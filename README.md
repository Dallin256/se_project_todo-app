The simple TODO app

Welcome to your very own task checklist!
this app is here to help you get things done buy logging tasks
along with a due date that you set; And if things are piling up and stressing you out? No worries, just use the delete button next to every task.

TLDR? well, here is a list of all the features!

    + can add a task with a short description & due date
    + can delete tasks anytime
    + can check & uncheck tasks

This site utilizes javascript along with HTML and CSS to give it
more functionality.
It has a user friendly interface and soft visuals
for a wide appeal and ease of use. Users can easily interact with the site
using these intuitive controls made possible with Javascript.
It has also been recently reorganized using Object Oriented Programming (OOP);
This has impoved our ability to scale the project and potentially
add new features and scale the project.
